# RainDropModel
Program which models rain drops; used to determine whether walking or running is better in vertical rainfall.
I spread out raindrops in a lattice-like structure and had them fall at terminal velocity in accordance to their average 
dimensions, then sent an object through with certain dimensions and at a user specified speed and recorded the number of
raindrops that the object "hit".
