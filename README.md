# RainDropModel
Program which models rain drops; used to determine whether walking or running is better in vertical rainfall.
I spread out raindrops in a lattice-like structure and had them fall at terminal velocity in accordance to their average 
dimensions, then sent an object through with certain dimensions and at a user specified speed and recorded the number of
raindrops that the object "hit". The results which I observed for a rectangle with average human dimensions are included below.

Results-
  
   Speed(m/s)      # of raindrops
    (.5                  59,865)
    (1.0                 59,940)
    (1.5                 59,960)
    (2.0                 59,975)
    (2.5                 59,980)
    (3.0                 59,985)
    (4.0                 59,995)
    (5.0                 60,000)
    (6.0                 60,000)
   (10.0                 60,000)

Conclusion-
According to my model of average rainfall rate over an average time period, the total amount of raindrops you hit is
independent of the speed at which you're moving. In terms of wetness, the only variable is the time spent in the rain because this does impact how much falls on you (top view). So it is mathematically suggested that you move as fast as you can in order to stay as dry as possible.
